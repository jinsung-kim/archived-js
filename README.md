# About

This is a creative project that I have envisioned for some time now. The name archived-js can be explained by deconstructing the two words. Archived simply meaning an old collection of something (in this case my pieces + writings) and js refers to the extension for Javascript files, which is what the project has been created from. The idea is to leave a digital fingerprint through a digital archive, one that can be simply run with one Javascript file (which is this React server). I wish to document my creative process, write about contemporary designers and artists that inspire me every day, and showcase how I evolve as a human being throughout my life.

## Running Locally

Install react and packages within package.json file. Then simply run:

```shell
npm start
```
